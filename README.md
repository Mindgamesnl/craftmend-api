# craftmend-api
A few public REST API's I made of things that interest me or I use in my own projects. Contains some minor documentation, do with it whatever you'd like. I own none of the outputted date, unless stated otherwise.

This repository contains simple documentation to my public api's, including go-models for their response types.

## Current API's
 - [Efteling API](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/craftmend-api/blob/master/efteling/README.md) Contains real-time efteling park information about shows, rides, and more.
 - [NS API](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/craftmend-api/blob/master/ns/README.md) Contains REST API's for station listing/details, departure times and routes.
