# craftmend-api
A few public REST API's I made of things that interest me or I use in my own projects. Contains some minor documentation, do with it whatever you'd like. I own none of the outputted date, unless stated otherwise.

This repository contains simple documentation to my public api's, including go-models for their response types.

## Current API's

 - [NS Sations API](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/craftmend-api/blob/master/ns-stations/README.md) Contains real-tiem info about departions from any given dutch station, including notes about the route (which stations it passes, train model and possible other notes like delay)
